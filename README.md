### Unprotected Store Credentials

Another vulnerability found is the unprotected storage of the application's admin credentials.

### Remote Code Execution (authenticated)

In the remote management panel there is a console written in the LUA language, which can be exploited to execute commands in the Operating System through the **os.execute()** function native to lua.

Below is a remote command execution PoC through the lua console to obtain a reverse shell on the target machine.
